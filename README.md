## Objective

The goal of this project is to design and implement an AI-driven recommendation system that analyzes user behavior and preferences to provide personalized recommendations for products or content.

## Key Components and Features

1. **User Behavior Tracking:**
   - Track and gather user behavior data, including interactions, clicks, and views.

2. **Data Pre-processing:**
   - Clean and preprocess collected data for quality and consistency.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Identify relevant features from user behavior data for machine learning models.

4. **Machine Learning Model:**
   - Choose and implement a suitable recommendation algorithm using Azure ML.

5. **Personalized Recommendations:**
   - Implement a mechanism for providing personalized recommendations based on user behavior.

6. **Integration with Cognitive Services:**
   - Enhance recommendations with Microsoft Cognitive Services, such as sentiment analysis.

7. **Scalability and Real-time Processing:**
   - Design for scalability and real-time processing to handle growing user bases.

8. **User Interface:**
   - Develop a user-friendly interface for interacting with the recommendation system.

9. **Documentation:**
   - Provide comprehensive documentation covering design decisions, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Submission Guidelines

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`.
3. Make your changes and commit: `git commit -m "Your clear and concise commit message"`.
4. Push changes to your branch: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`.
5. Submit a pull request.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **End-to-End ML Implementation:** Coverage of data pre-processing, feature engineering, and ML operationalization.
- **Personalization Accuracy:** Effectiveness of personalized recommendations based on user behavior.
- **Integration with Cognitive Services:** Leverage of Microsoft Cognitive Services for enhanced capabilities.
- **Scalability:** Design to handle a growing user base and increasing data volumes.
- **Documentation Quality:** Clarity, comprehensiveness, and user-friendliness of documentation.
